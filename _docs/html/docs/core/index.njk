<h1 class="Article-title">Core</h1>
<p class="c-text--lead">All Atomic core components at a glance.</p>

<p>Atomic consists of modular and extendible components, which can be combined with each other. Components are divided into different compartments according to their purpose and functionality.</p>

<ul class="c-panel-list o-flex-grid o-flex-grid--flush o-flex-grid--responsive o-flex-grid--gutters o-flex-grid@xl--gutters@xl o-flex-grid--full o-flex-grid@sm--1of2 o-flex-grid@lg--1of3">

      <h2 class="c-panel__title">Objects</h2>

    <div class="c-panel">
      <h2 class="c-panel__title">Elements</h2>

    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="o-flex-grid__cell">
    <div class="c-panel">
      <h2 class="c-panel__title">Navigation</h2>

  </li>
  <li class="o-flex-grid__cell">
    <div class="c-panel">
      <h2 class="c-panel__title">Modules</h2>
      <p>These components rely mostly on JavaScript to add dynamic functionality. Where possible these should be built unobtrusively (should still be available even if javascript isn't).</p>
    </div>
